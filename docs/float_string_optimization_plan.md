# Float/String Conversion Optimization Plan

## Objectives
- [ ] Close the performance gap versus state-of-the-art float/string conversion routines while preserving exact IEEE-754 semantics.
- [ ] Maintain full compliance with existing tests and external API contracts.
- [ ] Produce measurable improvements on the repository's benchmarks and representative real-world workloads.

## Ground Rules
- [ ] Always run the release benchmark suite both before and after every optimization attempt (currently `timeout 180 ./build.sh` followed by `output/release/benchmarkToString`).
- [ ] Publish benchmark results for each optimization using the standardized format documented below so that performance history stays auditable.
- [ ] Always execute the 10,000,000-iteration `compareWithRyu` fuzz regression (`output/release/compareWithRyu 10000000`) when validating changes, and record any discrepancies.

## Measurement Baseline
- [ ] Reproduce the current performance numbers by running the benchmark suite referenced by `./build.sh` and any additional float/string microbenchmarks.
- [ ] Capture CPU architecture, compiler flags, and input corpus characteristics for reproducibility.
- [ ] Record profiles (e.g., `perf`, VTune, or `Instruments`) to pinpoint hot spots before making changes.

## Workstream A: Environment Setup Optimizations
- [x] **Reduce `StandardFPEnvScope` cost.**
   - [x] Audit all call sites in the parser and formatter to determine whether redundant floating-point environment resets occur.
   - [x] Experiment with thread-local fast paths that skip environment changes when the default rounding mode is already active.
   - [x] Validate that any skip logic maintains determinism in multi-threaded scenarios.
- [x] **Batch environment transitions.**
   - [x] Investigate hoisting the environment scope out of tight conversion loops so it is entered once per batch instead of per value.
   - [x] Update callers that perform bulk conversions to amortize the setup cost.

## Workstream B: Parsing Fast Paths
- [ ] **Stage digits in integer form.**
   - [ ] Implement an initial loop that consumes up to 18 significant digits into a 64-bit accumulator before converting to `DoubleDouble`.
   - [ ] Benchmark the cutoff point (e.g., 18 vs. 19 digits) to balance precision and overhead.
- [ ] **Table-driven magnitude handling.**
   - [ ] Precompute powers of ten for the most common exponent ranges and replace repetitive `DoubleDouble / 10` operations with lookups.
   - [ ] Ensure the table covers denormals and extreme exponents; fall back to the existing path when out of range.
- [ ] **Profile-guided tuning.**
   - [ ] Use microbenchmarks with typical JSON/CSV numeric strings to measure the impact of the fast path before and after implementation.

## Workstream C: Formatting Improvements
- [x] **Direct digit extraction.**
   - [x] Replace the inner digit-selection loop with a quotient-based approach that derives each digit via a single `DoubleDouble` division.
   - [x] Verify rounding correctness across boundaries (0–9) and for tie cases.
- [x] **Reuse `scaleAndRound` results.**
   - [x] Cache intermediate scaling values and reuse them across digit iterations to avoid duplicate computations.
   - [x] Confirm that memoization does not introduce stale state between iterations.
- [ ] **Efficient exponent estimation.**
   - [ ] Prototype an `ilogb`/bit-inspection path to replace repeated `frexp` calls.
   - [ ] Validate the approach across all supported platforms and compilers.

## Workstream D: Benchmarking & Validation
- [ ] Extend existing benchmarks to cover mixed workloads (short decimals, long decimals, edge cases like denormals, NaNs, infinities).
- [ ] Compare against reference implementations (e.g., Ryu, double-conversion) using identical inputs.
- [ ] Track performance regressions continuously; add automated alerts if throughput drops below baseline.

## Benchmark Reporting Format
- [ ] Log the machine name, compiler, and exact commands used for every measurement run.
- [ ] Record results in the standard table below so comparisons stay consistent across optimizations.
