# Float/String Optimization Plan

## Deferred or Abandoned Ideas
- [ ] Bit-level exponent helpers in the formatter *(rolled back; no measurable performance gain, deemed pointless for now).* 

## Guiding Principle
- Always benchmark before and after each proposed optimization; if an idea does not deliver a significant speedup, revert it immediately.
