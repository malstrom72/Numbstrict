# Float/String Conversion Optimization Plan

## Objectives
- [ ] Close the performance gap versus state-of-the-art float/string conversion routines while preserving exact IEEE-754 semantics.
- [ ] Maintain full compliance with existing tests and external API contracts.
- [ ] Produce measurable improvements on the repository's benchmarks and representative real-world workloads.

## Measurement Baseline
- [ ] Reproduce the current performance numbers by running the benchmark suite referenced by `./build.sh` and any additional float/string microbenchmarks.
- [ ] Capture CPU architecture, compiler flags, and input corpus characteristics for reproducibility.
- [ ] Record profiles (e.g., `perf`, VTune, or `Instruments`) to pinpoint hot spots before making changes.

## Workstream A: Environment Setup Optimizations
- [ ] **Reduce `StandardFPEnvScope` cost.**
   - [ ] Audit all call sites in the parser and formatter to determine whether redundant floating-point environment resets occur.
   - [ ] Experiment with thread-local fast paths that skip environment changes when the default rounding mode is already active.
   - [ ] Validate that any skip logic maintains determinism in multi-threaded scenarios.
- [ ] **Batch environment transitions.**
   - [ ] Investigate hoisting the environment scope out of tight conversion loops so it is entered once per batch instead of per value.
   - [ ] Update callers that perform bulk conversions to amortize the setup cost.

## Workstream B: Parsing Fast Paths
- [ ] **Stage digits in integer form.**
   - [ ] Implement an initial loop that consumes up to 18 significant digits into a 64-bit accumulator before converting to `DoubleDouble`.
   - [ ] Benchmark the cutoff point (e.g., 18 vs. 19 digits) to balance precision and overhead.
- [ ] **Table-driven magnitude handling.**
   - [ ] Precompute powers of ten for the most common exponent ranges and replace repetitive `DoubleDouble / 10` operations with lookups.
   - [ ] Ensure the table covers denormals and extreme exponents; fall back to the existing path when out of range.
- [ ] **Profile-guided tuning.**
   - [ ] Use microbenchmarks with typical JSON/CSV numeric strings to measure the impact of the fast path before and after implementation.

## Workstream C: Formatting Improvements
- [ ] **Direct digit extraction.**
   - [ ] Replace the inner digit-selection loop with a quotient-based approach that derives each digit via a single `DoubleDouble` division.
   - [ ] Verify rounding correctness across boundaries (0â€“9) and for tie cases.
- [ ] **Reuse `scaleAndRound` results.**
   - [ ] Cache intermediate scaling values and reuse them across digit iterations to avoid duplicate computations.
   - [ ] Confirm that memoization does not introduce stale state between iterations.
- [ ] **Efficient exponent estimation.**
   - [ ] Prototype an `ilogb`/bit-inspection path to replace repeated `frexp` calls.
   - [ ] Validate the approach across all supported platforms and compilers.

## Workstream D: Benchmarking & Validation
- [ ] Extend existing benchmarks to cover mixed workloads (short decimals, long decimals, edge cases like denormals, NaNs, infinities).
- [ ] Compare against reference implementations (e.g., Ryu, double-conversion) using identical inputs.
- [ ] Track performance regressions continuously; add automated alerts if throughput drops below baseline.

## Risk Mitigation
- [ ] Maintain a full suite of unit tests and fuzzers; run them after each major change.
- [ ] Document any changes in rounding behavior and add targeted regression tests.
- [ ] Keep fallbacks to the current implementation until the new paths are proven robust.

## Deliverables
- [ ] Implementation branches for parsing and formatting optimizations, each with dedicated benchmarks and profiling data.
- [ ] Documentation updates summarizing new algorithms and configuration knobs.
- [ ] Final report comparing throughput and accuracy before and after optimizations.
